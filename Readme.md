# AI Game Engine

A powerful platform for creating and running AI-driven games where players compete using custom scripts. The engine
supports multiple games, real-time gameplay visualization, and comprehensive statistics tracking.

## Features

- Multi-game support with customizable game logic
- Real-time game visualization using WebSocket communication
- Player script execution in isolated processes
- Team-based gameplay mechanics
- Live statistics and replay functionality
- Lobby system for game session management
- Redis-based event messaging system
- Docker containerization for easy deployment

## Tech Stack

- Python Flask backend with SocketIO
- Redis for real-time messaging
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker and Docker Compose
- JavaScript frontend SDK

## Quick Start

### Production Deployment

1. Create `config.py` based on `config.py.example`
2. Run script `python create_game.py` to create a game
3. Put your game files in `games/{game_name}/`
4. Run for production:

```bash
# Production deployment
docker compose up -d
```

### Development Setup

1. Create `config.py` based on `config.py.example`
2. Run for development:

```bash
# Development setup
docker compose -f compose-dev.yml build
python setup.py
python create_game.py
python server.py
```

## Architecture

- Game sessions run in isolated processes
- Real-time updates via Redis pub/sub
- Secure script execution environment
- Modular game implementation system
- Team and player management
- Session replay capabilities
